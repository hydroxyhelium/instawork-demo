# Instaork demo application README

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

set up the local environment using the requirements.txt file

```
pip3 install -r instawork/requirements.txt
```

apply migrations using

```
python3 manage.py migrate
```

run server at local host 8000 using

```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

Alternatively you can run the setup.sh script that I created, which does all the above mentioned things

```
chmod a+x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
